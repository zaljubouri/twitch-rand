        This site is a visual representation of a hash-based (SHA-256) deterministic random bit
        generatorâ€”or DRBG. The source of entropy is the time between messages on the current most
        popular Twitch streamers' chats.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the algorithm used adheres to <a href="https://www.nist.gov/">NIST</a> specifications
        for cryptographically-secure DRBGs, the entropy source has not been vetted as truly random,
        and is also completely public, thus open to manipulation. Please do <b>not</b> use the
        generated numbers by this DRBG for cryptographic purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DRBG was written using <code>Node.js</code> and <code>TypeScript</code>. This site was
        created using <code>React</code>. A more detailed walkthrough of the entire creation process
        can be found on my <a href="https://www.zaljubouri.com/">website</a>.
